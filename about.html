	<h2>About Me:</h2>
	<p>I am a gradating senior with Bachelors of Arts in Economics. I live in Amherst MA with a couple of my friends. I'm twenty-one soon to be twenty-two and most of this is just filler.</p>
	<h2>Experience:</h2>
	<p>I've had little previous experience with any programming. I took a computer science class which was an intro to Java. Other than several tutorials on codeacademy.com and all of the Dash tutorials.</p>
